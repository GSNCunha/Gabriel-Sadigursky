I started programming C in 2013 in my Robotics class, which lasted until 2019, where I won several awards like 5th place in the world in robocup in 2014. unfortunately I don't have programs from that time. I went to Control and Automation Engineering College in 2020, where I learned more about C and Java. Since 2020 I'm looking for more knowledge in Web Development, in videos on youtube, some classes with ex-teachers and the Frontend Masters course.
