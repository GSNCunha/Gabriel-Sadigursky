I started programming C in 2013 in my Robotics class, which ran until 2019. unfortunately I don't have programs from that time. I went to control engineering and automation university in 2020 where I learned more about C and Java. Since 2020 I'm looking for more knowledge in Web Development, which is my main focus now
